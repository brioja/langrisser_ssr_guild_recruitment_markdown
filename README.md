**Guild Name**

SSR

**Guild Leader**

Godgirl with Katakuri and Akka j as vice leaders.

**Server**

Ancient Ruin

**Type** 

PvP and PvE. We do it all.

**Description** 

We are looking for new members to join us! 

We join alternating guilds to run 3x guild battles per week.

Because we are usually swapping guilds on the weekend, we ask members to join our discord server so we can still stay in touch.

For Dimensional Expedition, we have placed second... every time. We want some more active members so we can change that next time around. 

In Ancient Beckoning, our members hold spots 1, 2, and 5 as well as many other positions in the top 20.

For PvP, although we are not the best PvP guild in the server, we have some stronger players with a few of our members going deep into playoffs.

** What sets our guild apart ** 

The best thing about our guild is that we always take the time to help out our guild members when they are stuck on something. For the last Endless Voyage Event, everyone who asked for help was able to complete the event. 

We also like to help our guild complete challenges. Even if they don't have the best heroes to do it. 

Free example tip that helped for one of the challenges: Did you know that Narm and Gustav can apply a permanent silence that can't be dispelled?

So if you like playing the game as much as we do, come give our guild a try!
